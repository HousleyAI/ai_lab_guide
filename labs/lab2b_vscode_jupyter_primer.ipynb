    "### What is this Jupyter Notebook and How to Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is an environment where you can write and run Python code interactively. It allows you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document, making it great for data analysis, machine learning and educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook is running within vscode locally on your jumphost. There are also AI workbenches provided by Redhat and NVIDIA, that can allow you to run Jupyter Notebooks in a standardised setup both locally or on a remote server\n",

    "### Jupyter Notebooks Cells\n",
    "There are two types of cells that are supported by notebooks: Markdown and Code\n",
    " \n",
    "**Markdown Cells** \n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses simple formatting syntax to create formatted text documents, such as web pages, documentation and readme files. It's designed to be easy to read and write, with a plain-text format that can be easily converted to HTML or other formats\n",
    "Details of the Markdown format are provided at the following site\n",
    "https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/\n",
    "\n",
    "Double click this cell to see the markdown in action. Click Tick at top of cell to re-render\n",

    "**Code Cells**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks allows you to execute both Python and shell commands inside **code** cells\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any text in a code cell without a prefix is interpreted as Python code\n",
    "* To execute a shell command, prefix it with an exclamation mark (`!`). This is how you will run `oc` commands throughout this lab.\n",
    "  * Note: These shell commands could also be run directly from the linux terminal\n",
    "* Text with a # prefix is interpreted as a comment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Run Cells\n",
    "* Run cells in order since later ones often depend on earlier results, as variables are persisted between cells\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to execute code:\n",
    "* Click the \"Run\" triangle button in the top-right corner of any cell.  Also triangle on top left of code cell\n",
    "* Use keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "    * `Ctrl + Enter` runs the current cell and stays there\n",
    "    * `Shift + Enter` runs the current cell and moves to the next one\n",
    "* There is also a \"Run All\" option at the top, but it's best to run them step-by-step for learning\n",
    "* Once a cell is run, its output will be displayed below it and a green checkmark will appear next to the cell\n",
    "* The kernel can be restarted (Using Restart at the top), if you want to clear all variables and outputs. This is useful if you want to start fresh or if you encounter errors."
